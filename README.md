University Attendance Tracker
📄 Project Overview
The University Attendance Tracker is a web-based application designed to help university instructors manage and track student attendance in an organized and efficient manner. The platform provides a simple yet effective way to record student presence for each class session while offering an intuitive user interface that is both easy to use and responsive across various devices.

This application allows authorized users (such as professors or administrators) to:

Log in to the system with secure credentials.

Select the course and date for attendance tracking.

Register new students and add them to the attendance table.

Mark attendance for each student with a simple click to indicate whether the student is present or absent.

View and manage the attendance data for each class session.

🚀 Features
Secure Login System

The system is protected with a login mechanism to ensure only authorized personnel (teachers or admins) can access the attendance data.

Course and Date Selection

Users can easily select the course and date for which they wish to mark attendance. This allows for organized management of attendance across multiple classes.

Student Registration

New students can be registered directly within the application. Once registered, they will automatically appear in the attendance table, making it easier to track their attendance.

Mark Attendance with One Click

Marking a student as "Present" or "Absent" is as simple as clicking a button. Once a student is marked present, the status changes to visually reflect the action.

Visual Feedback on Attendance Status

The system provides clear visual feedback, where students marked as present are shown with a green status and those marked as absent appear in red, making it easy for instructors to review attendance.

Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Whether you are at home or in class, the app adapts to your screen size.

Extensibility

The system is designed with extensibility in mind. In the future, it could be integrated with features like exporting attendance data (CSV, Excel) for record-keeping and reporting purposes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the pages and content of the app.

CSS: Used for styling the layout and making the app visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript: Used to handle user interactions, such as logging in, marking attendance, and dynamically updating the attendance table.

🔒 Security Features
The application ensures that only users with the correct credentials can access the attendance tracking system. The current security level includes basic authentication through a username and password system (which can be further improved for production).

💡 Future Improvements
Data Persistence: Implementing local storage or server-side storage to retain data after the page is refreshed or reloaded.

Attendance Reports: Adding the ability to export attendance data into CSV or Excel format for further analysis and record-keeping.

Multi-user Access: Allowing multiple users (e.g., different teachers or administrators) to manage attendance for different courses.
